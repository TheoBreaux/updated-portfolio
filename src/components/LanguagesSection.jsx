      <p>
        During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, I found myself
        unemployed in the hospitality and entertainment industries. Seizing the
        opportunity to learn new skills, I enrolled in the Google Data Analytics
        Specialization on Coursera. It was during this time, while exploring the
        R Programming language, that I discovered my passion for programming and
        subsequently delved into software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey led me to explore other programming languages, starting with
        JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. As I immersed myself in coding, my interest
        and love for the craft flourished. Over the past few years, while
        pursuing a second bachelor&#39;s degree in Software Engineering at
        Western Governors University and holding a B.A. in Marketing/Advertising
        from Lake Forest College, I have honed my skills in various technical
        disciplines. I am proficient in React.js, React Native, Redux, Node.js,
        PostgreSQL, and crafting efficient solutions through RESTful APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        What truly sets me apart is my diverse background spanning multiple
        industries, which imbues me with a unique perspective. This perspective
        champions creative solutions and embraces the complexities of modern
        challenges. Beyond my technical acumen, my problem-solving approach is
        characterized by a blend of creativity and innovation, making me a
        valuable asset in any team.
